## üéØ Welcome to the Team!

This private repository contains our comprehensive Claude Code resource hub. You now have access to contribute to this internal documentation project that may eventually serve our broader community.

## üîë Repository Access & Permissions

### Access Levels
- **Admin**: Full repository control (repository owners)
- **Write**: Can push to development branches, create PRs
- **Read**: Can view content and clone repository

### Getting Repository Access
1. **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have a GitHub account with 2FA enabled
2. **Team Invitation**: Repository admin will send you an invitation
3. **Accept Invitation**: Check your email and accept the repository invitation
4. **Set Up Local Environment**: Follow the setup instructions below

## üöÄ Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the private repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-hub-private.git
cd claude-code-hub-private

# Verify you're on the correct repository
git remote -v
```

### 2. Understand Branch Structure
```bash
# Main branch - production-ready content
git checkout main

# Development branch - active development work
git checkout development

# Community contributions - external PR staging
git checkout community-contributions

# Your work should typically happen on feature branches
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Install any dependencies (if applicable)
npm install  # If Node.js tools are added later

# Set up Git configuration for this project
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@company.com"
```

## üìã Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Pull latest changes from `development` branch
2. **Work**: Create feature branches for your work
3. **Testing**: Test documentation with Claude Code if applicable  
4. **PR**: Create pull request to `development` branch
5. **Review**: Team reviews and approves changes
6. **Merge**: Changes merged to development, then to main

### Branch Protection Rules
- **main**: Requires PR review, no direct pushes
- **development**: Requires PR review for external contributors
- **feature/***: Can be created freely by team members

### Commit Message Convention
Use conventional commits format:
```bash
# Feature additions
git commit -m "feat: add new MCP server example for OpenAI"

# Documentation updates  
git commit -m "docs: improve installation guide for Windows"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: correct broken links in subagents section"
