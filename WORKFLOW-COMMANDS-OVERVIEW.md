## 📊 Workflow Integration Patterns

### Daily Workflow Integration
```yaml
Morning (9:00 AM):
  - Execute: daily.md
  - Review: Generated summary and todos
  - Time: 5 minutes

Throughout Day:
  - Use: quick-capture.md (as needed)
  - Use: idea-capture.md (for innovations)
  - Time: 30 seconds per capture

Project Work:
  - Reference: component-save.md
  - Generate: content-create.md
  - Verify: voice-analyze.md

End of Day (5:00 PM):
  - Review: Captured items
  - Update: project-status.md
  - Time: 10 minutes

Weekly (Fridays):
  - Execute: weekly-review.md
  - Validate: microsaas ideas
  - Plan: Next week priorities
  - Time: 30 minutes
```

### Cross-Command Synergies

#### Content Creation Flow
```
idea-capture → content-create → voice-analyze → email-draft
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
  [Idea]      [Blog Post]    [Brand Check]   [Promotion]
```

#### Client Management Flow
```
client-new → project-status → email-draft → weekly-review
     ↓            ↓               ↓              ↓
[Onboard]    [Track]         [Communicate]   [Analyze]
```

#### Development Flow
```
idea-capture → microsaas-validate → component-save → ai-agent-doc
     ↓                ↓                   ↓               ↓
  [Concept]      [Validate]          [Build]        [Document]
```
