# üìÖ Daily Activity Scanner & Memory Builder

> **The Foundation Command**: Builds persistent AI memory by analyzing daily activities and creating comprehensive summaries

---

## üéØ Command Purpose

This command transforms your daily work chaos into structured intelligence by:

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Daily Notes Structure
```
Your Workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Daily Operations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Daily Notes/           # Where summaries are created
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weekly Reviews/        # Weekly pattern analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Meeting Notes/         # Referenced in summaries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard.md               # Updated with daily highlights
```

### Step 2: Configure the Command
Save this file as `.claude/commands/daily.md` in your workspace.

### Step 3: Create Daily Workflow Habit
```bash
# Morning: Start your day with context
claude "/daily"

# Evening: Reflect and prepare for tomorrow  
claude "/daily" "Include reflection on challenges and wins"
```

### Step 4: Customize for Your Work Style
Modify the scanning areas and summary structure to match your specific needs:

```yaml
# Example customizations:
scanning_areas:
  - "Projects/Active/"          # Your active project folder
  - "Clients/Current/"          # Your client work area  
  - "Daily Notes/"              # Your daily journaling area
  - "[Your Custom Folder]/"    # Any important work area

summary_sections:
  - "Completed Tasks"           # Standard sections
  - "Client Activities"         
  - "Development Work"
  - "[Your Custom Section]"    # Add sections relevant to your work
```

## üîß Troubleshooting & Optimization

### Common Issues

#### "Too Much Information"
**Problem**: Daily summaries become overwhelming
**Solution**: Focus on top 5 achievements and 3 tomorrow priorities
**Customization**: Limit sections to most important work areas

#### "Missing Important Items"  
**Problem**: Key activities not captured in scan
**Solution**: Add specific folders/files to scanning configuration
**Enhancement**: Use manual highlights for critical activities

#### "Generic Summaries"
**Problem**: Summaries lack specific insights
**Solution**: Include more context about decisions and learnings
**Improvement**: Add reflection prompts for deeper analysis

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Workspaces**: Focus scanning on active project folders
- **Slow Generation**: Use incremental summaries throughout the day
- **Memory Usage**: Archive old summaries while preserving key insights
