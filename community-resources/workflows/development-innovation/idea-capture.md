  "idea_capture": {
    "categories": {
      "microsaas": "Ideas Hub/MicroSaaS/Implementation Queue/",
      "app": "Ideas Hub/App Concepts/",
      "feature": "Project Pipeline/Feature Ideas/",
      "content": "Content Creation/Ideas/",
      "business": "Business Development/Opportunities/"
    },
    "auto_enrich": true,
    "weekly_review": true,
    "validation_threshold": 3
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Capture Ideas
```bash
# Ultra-quick capture (10 seconds)
claude "/idea-capture micro 'SaaS for developer productivity'"

# Standard capture (1 minute)
claude "/idea-capture app"
# Then provide details when prompted

# Detailed capture (5 minutes)
claude "/idea-capture microsaas detailed"
# Full template with validation framework
```

### Step 3: Review and Prioritize
The system automatically:
- Adds "now" priority ideas to your todo list
- Schedules "soon" ideas for weekly review
- Archives "someday" ideas with quarterly reminders
