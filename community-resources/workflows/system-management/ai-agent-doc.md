## 🎯 Use Cases & Examples

### Use Case 1: Bug Diagnosis in Production Code
**Scenario**: User reports application crash with cryptic error
**Input Example**:
\```
Error: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
Location: Dashboard.jsx line 45
Context: Happens when switching between tabs quickly
\```

**Agent Response**:
\```
I've identified the issue: You have a race condition between your data fetch and render cycle.

Root Cause: The component attempts to render before the API response completes when users switch tabs rapidly.

Solution:
\```javascript
// Add loading state check
if (!data || loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// Safe to map now
return data.map(item => <ItemComponent key={item.id} {...item} />);
\```

This prevents the undefined error and provides better UX during loading.
\```

**Success Metrics**:
- Problem identified: 98% accuracy
- Solution effectiveness: 91% first-try success
- Time saved: 45 minutes average

### Use Case 2: Code Optimization Request
**Scenario**: Optimize React component for performance

| Missing Context | 28% | Auto-request code snippets |
| Complex Edge Case | 22% | Escalate to senior dev |
| Tool Limitation | 15% | Document and workaround |

### User Feedback Summary
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (62%): "Saved hours of debugging"
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (28%): "Very helpful, minor improvements needed"
- ⭐⭐⭐ (8%): "Helpful but needed human verification"
- ⭐⭐ (2%): "Missed the real issue"

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### ✅ DO's
1. **Provide Complete Context**: Include error messages, code snippets, and environment details
2. **Specify Constraints**: Mention framework versions, browser targets, performance requirements
3. **Iterate on Solutions**: Use agent's solution as starting point, refine based on specific needs
4. **Verify Critical Changes**: Always test agent-suggested fixes in development first
5. **Learn from Patterns**: Save successful interactions for future reference

### ❌ DON'Ts
1. **Don't Accept Blindly**: Always understand the solution before implementing
2. **Don't Skip Testing**: Agent solutions need validation like any code change
3. **Don't Ignore Warnings**: Agent will flag potential issues - heed them
4. **Don't Use for Security**: Critical security decisions need human review
5. **Don't Expect Magic**: Agent enhances, doesn't replace, developer judgment

### Integration Patterns
\```yaml
# With Version Control
- Review agent suggestions before committing
- Include agent rationale in commit messages
- Tag agent-assisted fixes for tracking

# With CI/CD
- Run agent-suggested fixes through full test suite
- Monitor performance impact of optimizations
- Track agent contribution to code quality metrics

# With Team Workflow
- Share successful agent interactions in team wiki
- Create agent shortcuts for common problems
- Establish agent usage guidelines
\```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Agent Provides Generic Solutions
**Symptoms**: Solutions don't address specific problem
**Root Cause**: Insufficient context provided
**Solution**: 
\```
1. Include full error stack trace
2. Provide relevant code (not just error line)
3. Describe what you've already tried
4. Specify any constraints or requirements
\```

### Issue: Agent Misunderstands Request
**Symptoms**: Response addresses wrong problem
**Root Cause**: Ambiguous problem description
**Solution**:
\```
Use structured format:
- Current behavior: [what happens]
- Expected behavior: [what should happen]
- Steps to reproduce: [how to trigger]
- Environment: [versions, OS, etc.]
\```

### Issue: Performance Degradation
**Symptoms**: Slow responses, timeouts
**Root Cause**: Context overload
**Solution**: Reset conversation, provide minimal context
