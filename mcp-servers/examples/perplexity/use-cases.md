## üìä Metrics & Tracking

### Search Effectiveness

Track these metrics to optimize your search workflows:

1. **Query Success Rate**: How often you get useful results
2. **Time to Insight**: How quickly you find needed information
3. **Action Conversion**: How often searches lead to concrete actions
4. **Knowledge Retention**: How well information is documented

### ROI Calculation

```javascript
// Example ROI tracking
const searchROI = {
  timesSaved: {
    manualResearch: 2, // hours per search
    searches: 10, // per week
    hourlyRate: 100
  },
  qualityImprovement: {
    bugsPrevented: 5,
    averageBugCost: 500
  },
  weeklyValue: (2 * 10 * 100) + (5 * 500) // $4,500
};
```
