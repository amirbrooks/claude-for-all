## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Prompting Formula

```
CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT + CONSTRAINTS = GREAT RESULTS

CONTEXT: "I'm working on a React TypeScript project..."
TASK: "Create a reusable Button component..."
FORMAT: "Include TypeScript interfaces, JSDoc, and tests..."
CONSTRAINTS: "Follow our team's style guide and use Tailwind CSS..."
```

### Thinking Mode Quick Reference

```bash
# Basic analysis
"Analyze this code for potential issues"

# Complex problem solving  
"think hard: How can I optimize this database query for better performance?"

# Maximum reasoning power
"ultrathink: Design a scalable architecture for handling 1M concurrent users"
```

### Plan Mode Activation

```
Press Shift+Tab before complex requests to activate Plan Mode:
- Multi-file operations
- Complex refactoring tasks
- System architecture changes
- Large-scale implementations
```

## üéØ Key Principles

### 1. **Be Specific and Clear**
```markdown
‚ùå Vague: "Fix this code"
‚úÖ Specific: "Fix the memory leak in this React component by properly cleaning up event listeners in useEffect"
```

### 2. **Provide Sufficient Context**
```markdown
‚ùå No context: "Add authentication"
‚úÖ With context: "Add JWT-based authentication to this Express.js API, following our existing middleware pattern in auth.js"
```

### 3. **Define Success Criteria**
```markdown
‚ùå Open-ended: "Make it better"
‚úÖ Clear criteria: "Improve performance to load under 2 seconds and achieve 95+ Lighthouse score"
```

### 4. **Use Progressive Refinement**
```markdown
1. Start with high-level request
2. Review initial response
3. Refine with specific feedback
4. Iterate until satisfied
```

## üß© Prompting Patterns

### The STAR Method

**S**ituation: Current state and context  
**T**ask: What needs to be accomplished  
**A**ction: Specific actions to take  
**R**esult: Expected outcome and format  

```
Situation: "I have a slow-loading React app with bundle size issues"
Task: "Optimize the application for better performance"
Action: "Analyze bundle size, implement code splitting, optimize images"
Result: "Provide specific recommendations with implementation code"
```

### The Component Pattern

Break complex requests into components:

```
Primary Goal: [Main objective]
Sub-tasks:
1. [Specific task 1]
2. [Specific task 2]  
3. [Specific task 3]

Constraints:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

Output Format:
- [Format specification]
```

### The Iterative Pattern

Build complexity gradually:

```
Phase 1: "Create a basic user authentication system"
Phase 2: "Add role-based permissions to the auth system"
Phase 3: "Implement session management and refresh tokens"
Phase 4: "Add OAuth integration with Google and GitHub"
```

## üé≠ Voice and Style

### Establishing Your Voice

Define your communication preferences:

```yaml
Technical Level: Senior developer
Communication Style: Direct and concise
Code Preferences: TypeScript, functional programming
Documentation Style: Comprehensive with examples
Error Handling: Explicit and detailed
```

### Voice Consistency Techniques

1. **Create Style Templates**
   ```markdown
   When writing documentation:
   - Start with clear overview
   - Include practical examples
   - Add troubleshooting section
   - End with related resources
   ```

2. **Define Code Standards**
   ```typescript
   // Preferred patterns
   const useCustomHook = () => { /* ... */ }
   
   // Documentation style
   /**
    * Custom hook for managing user authentication
    * @returns {object} Authentication state and methods
    */
   ```

3. **Maintain Consistency**
   ```bash
   claude "Review this text for consistency with my established voice profile"
   ```

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Ambiguous Requests**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "Help me with this project"
   ‚úÖ "Help me implement user registration with email verification"
   ```

2. **Missing Context**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "This isn't working"
   ‚úÖ "This React component isn't re-rendering when props change. Here's the code: [code]"
   ```

3. **Overwhelming Complexity**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "Build a complete e-commerce platform with payment, inventory, users, admin panel..."
   ‚úÖ "Let's start with a simple product catalog component, then build from there"
   ```

4. **Ignoring Constraints**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "Make it work somehow"
   ‚úÖ "Implement this using only built-in browser APIs, no external libraries"
   ```

## üìä Prompting Effectiveness

### Measuring Success

Track these indicators:
- **First-time accuracy**: How often you get useful results immediately
- **Iteration count**: Average refinements needed
- **Task completion**: Successful end-to-end completion rate
- **Code quality**: How often generated code works without modification

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Learn from Patterns**
   - Save successful prompts as templates
   - Analyze what makes prompts effective
   - Build a personal prompt library

2. **Refine Incrementally**
   - Start with working solution
   - Iteratively improve quality
   - Add constraints progressively

3. **Use Context Efficiently**
   - Provide relevant information only
   - Structure context logically
   - Update context as needed

## üéØ Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Modal Prompting

Combine different types of input:

```
Text: "Analyze this UI design and suggest improvements"
Image: [Screenshot of interface]
Code: [Existing implementation]
Context: "This is for a mobile-first e-commerce app"
```

### Conditional Logic

Use if-then patterns:

```
If this is a React component:
  - Add TypeScript interfaces
  - Include error boundaries
  - Add accessibility props

If this is a Node.js API:
  - Add input validation
  - Include error handling
  - Add rate limiting
```

### Template Systems

Create reusable prompt templates:

```markdown
# Component Creation Template

Create a {{component_type}} component named {{component_name}} that:
- Accepts these props: {{prop_list}}
- Follows our design system: {{design_system_url}}
- Includes accessibility features: {{a11y_requirements}}
- Has comprehensive tests: {{testing_requirements}}

Output format:
1. Component code with TypeScript
2. Storybook stories
3. Unit tests
4. Usage documentation
```

## üì± Platform-Specific Tips

### Desktop App
- Use keyboard shortcuts effectively
- Leverage file drag-and-drop
- Utilize multiple workspace features

### Web Interface
- Use browser bookmarks for common prompts
- Leverage browser extensions
- Save chat history for reference

### Mobile
- Use voice input for quick captures
- Keep prompts concise
- Use templates for common patterns

## ü§ù Collaboration Patterns

### Team Prompting Standards

Establish team guidelines:

```yaml
Code Style: ESLint config + Prettier
Documentation: JSDoc for all public APIs
Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
Architecture: Feature-based folder structure
```

### Prompt Sharing

Share effective prompts:
- Create team prompt library
- Document successful patterns
- Share templates and workflows
