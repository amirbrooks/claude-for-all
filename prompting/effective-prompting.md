# üéØ Effective Prompting

> Master the fundamentals of clear, actionable communication with Claude Code

## üìñ Overview

Effective prompting is the foundation of productive Claude Code usage. This guide covers the essential techniques for crafting clear, specific requests that consistently produce high-quality results.

## üé™ The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

### The CLEAR Framework

Every effective prompt should be:
- **C**oncise: Direct and to the point
- **L**ogical: Well-structured and easy to follow
- **E**xplicit: Specific about requirements and constraints
- **A**ctionable: Clear about what needs to be done
- **R**elevant: Focused on the actual problem

### Basic Prompt Structure

```
CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT + CONSTRAINTS = GREAT RESULTS

CONTEXT: "I'm working on a React TypeScript project using Tailwind CSS..."
TASK: "Create a reusable dropdown component..."
FORMAT: "Include TypeScript interfaces, accessibility features, and usage examples..."
CONSTRAINTS: "Must work with our existing design system and support keyboard navigation..."
```

## üöÄ Fundamental Techniques

### 1. **Provide Sufficient Context**

#### Poor Context
```
"Fix this code"
```

#### Good Context
```
"Fix this React component that should display user notifications but isn't re-rendering when new notifications arrive. I'm using Redux for state management and the component is wrapped with connect()."
```

#### Excellent Context
```
"Fix this React notification component that isn't re-rendering when new notifications are added to the Redux store. 

Current behavior: Component mounts correctly but doesn't update when notifications state changes
Expected behavior: Component should re-render and display new notifications immediately
Tech stack: React 18, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript
Related files: store/notificationsSlice.ts, components/NotificationList.tsx

[Include relevant code snippets]
```

### 2. **Be Specific About Requirements**

#### Vague Request
```
"Make this better"
```

#### Specific Request
```
"Optimize this React component for better performance by:
- Reducing unnecessary re-renders
- Memoizing expensive calculations  
- Implementing proper key props for lists
- Adding React.memo where appropriate

Target: Reduce render time by 50% while maintaining all current functionality"
```

### 3. **Define Success Criteria**

#### Without Success Criteria
```
"Improve the API performance"
```

#### With Clear Success Criteria
```
"Optimize the API to achieve:
- Response time under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Support for 1000 concurrent users
- Memory usage under 512MB
- Zero downtime deployment capability

Current baseline: 800ms average response, 100 concurrent users, 1GB memory"
```

### 4. **Specify Output Format**

#### Format Not Specified
```
"Explain how authentication works"
```

#### Format Clearly Specified
```
"Explain JWT authentication with:
1. Step-by-step flow diagram
2. Code examples in Node.js and React
3. Security best practices checklist
4. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
5. Testing strategies

Format as a comprehensive guide with code blocks and practical examples."
```

## üîß Advanced Prompting Patterns

### 1. **The Layer Cake Pattern**

Build complexity in layers:

```
Layer 1: "Create a basic user registration form"
Layer 2: "Add email validation and password strength checking"
Layer 3: "Include terms of service acceptance and captcha"
Layer 4: "Add accessibility features and error handling"
Layer 5: "Implement analytics tracking and A/B testing"
```

### 2. **The Constraint Sandwich**

Surround your request with constraints:

```
CONSTRAINT: "Must use only vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks"
REQUEST: "Create an interactive image carousel with thumbnails"
CONSTRAINT: "Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA) and work in IE11+"
```

### 3. **The Example-Driven Pattern**

Provide examples of what you want:

```
"Create CSS animations similar to these examples:
- Smooth fade-in on scroll (like Apple's website)
- Staggered card reveals (like Stripe's pricing page)  
- Hover effects with micro-interactions (like GitHub buttons)

Apply this style to our product showcase section with:
[specific requirements]"
```

### 4. **The Decision Tree Pattern**

Map out different scenarios:

```
"Create error handling that responds differently based on error type:

IF network error:
  - Show retry button
  - Cache user input
  - Offline mode if available

IF validation error:
  - Highlight specific fields
  - Show inline error messages
  - Prevent form submission

IF server error:
  - Show generic error message
  - Log error details
  - Offer contact support option"
```

## üìä Context Optimization

### Context Hierarchy

Organize information by importance:

```
1. CRITICAL: What you're trying to achieve
2. IMPORTANT: Technical constraints and requirements
3. USEFUL: Current implementation details
4. NICE-TO-HAVE: Preferences and suggestions
```

### Context Templates

#### Bug Report Template
```
BUG: [Brief description]
EXPECTED: [What should happen]
ACTUAL: [What actually happens]
REPRODUCTION: [Steps to reproduce]
ENVIRONMENT: [Browser, OS, versions]
CODE: [Relevant code snippets]
ATTEMPTS: [What you've already tried]
```

#### Feature Request Template
```
FEATURE: [What you want to build]
PURPOSE: [Why this is needed]
USERS: [Who will use this]
REQUIREMENTS: [Must-have features]
CONSTRAINTS: [Technical limitations]
SUCCESS: [How to measure success]
```

#### Code Review Template
```
REVIEW: [What to review]
FOCUS: [Specific areas of concern]
STANDARDS: [Coding standards to check]
PERFORMANCE: [Performance considerations]
SECURITY: [Security aspects to verify]
MAINTAINABILITY: [Long-term considerations]
```

## üéØ Task Decomposition

### Breaking Down Complex Requests

#### Monolithic Request (Avoid)
```
"Build a complete e-commerce platform with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, admin panel, inventory management, order tracking, email notifications, analytics, and mobile app"
```

#### Decomposed Approach (Better)
```
Phase 1: "Set up basic project structure with user authentication"
Phase 2: "Implement product catalog with search and filtering"
Phase 3: "Add shopping cart and checkout process"
Phase 4: "Integrate payment processing with Stripe"
Phase 5: "Build admin panel for inventory management"
[Continue with additional phases]
```

### Task Prioritization

Use priority indicators:

```
HIGH PRIORITY: Authentication system (blocks other features)
MEDIUM PRIORITY: Product search (improves UX)
LOW PRIORITY: Advanced analytics (nice to have)
FUTURE: Mobile app (next quarter)
```

## üìù Language and Tone

### Technical Precision

#### Vague Language
```
"Make it faster"
"Fix the broken thing"
"Add some styling"
```

#### Precise Language
```
"Reduce API response time from 2s to under 500ms"
"Fix the memory leak in the image upload component"
"Apply brand colors and typography from our design system"
```

### Action-Oriented Verbs

Use specific action verbs:
- **Create/Build**: For new implementations
- **Refactor**: For code restructuring
- **Optimize**: For performance improvements
- **Debug**: For problem solving
- **Integrate**: For connecting systems
- **Validate**: For testing and verification

### Avoiding Ambiguity

#### Ambiguous
```
"Update the styles"
```

#### Clear
```
"Update the button styles to match the new design system:
- Primary button: #007bff background, white text
- Secondary button: transparent background, #007bff border
- Hover states: 10% darker backgrounds
- Disabled state: 50% opacity"
```

## üîÑ Iterative Refinement

### The Spiral Approach

Start broad, then narrow down:

```
1. EXPLORE: "What are the options for implementing real-time features?"
2. ANALYZE: "Compare WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events for my use case"  
3. PLAN: "Design WebSocket architecture for chat application"
4. IMPLEMENT: "Build WebSocket connection manager with error handling"
5. OPTIMIZE: "Add connection pooling and message queuing"
```

### Feedback Loops

Use follow-up prompts to refine:

```
Initial: "Create a responsive navigation component"
Refinement: "Modify the navigation to include search functionality"
Polish: "Add smooth animations and accessibility features"
Optimization: "Reduce bundle size and improve performance"
```

### Course Correction

When results aren't quite right:

```
"The solution works but doesn't handle edge cases. Please add:
- Validation for empty inputs
- Error handling for network failures
- Loading states for async operations
- Proper cleanup on component unmount"
```

## üé® Prompt Templates

### Code Generation Template
```
CREATE: [Type of code/component]
PURPOSE: [What it should accomplish]
REQUIREMENTS: 
  - [Functional requirement 1]
  - [Functional requirement 2]

```

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Assumption Overload**

‚ùå **Assuming too much:**
```
"Add the validation"
```

‚úÖ **Being explicit:**
```
"Add client-side validation for the user registration form:
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements (8+ chars, special characters)
- Confirm password matching
- Terms of service acceptance required"
```

### 2. **Context Dumping**

‚ùå **Too much irrelevant context:**
```
"I'm building a project for my client who runs a small business selling handmade crafts. They started the business 5 years ago and have been growing steadily. The owner is not very technical but wants to modernize their operations. They currently use Excel for inventory but it's becoming unwieldy. They have about 500 products and 50 orders per week. The business is seasonal with peak sales in November and December. They also participate in craft fairs and farmers markets. Now I need help creating a dropdown component..."
```

‚úÖ **Relevant context only:**
```
"Create a dropdown component for a small business inventory system. Needs to handle ~500 product items with search functionality and must be accessible for non-technical users."
```

### 3. **Perfectionism Paralysis**

‚ùå **Trying to solve everything at once:**
```
"Create a perfect, enterprise-grade, highly scalable, fully tested, documented, accessible, performant user management system with all possible features"
```

‚úÖ **Progressive enhancement:**
```
"Create a basic user management system with login/logout functionality. We'll add features like password reset, user roles, and profile management in subsequent iterations."
```

### 4. **Vague Success Criteria**

‚ùå **Undefined success:**
```
"Make it work better"
```

‚úÖ **Measurable criteria:**
```
"Optimize to achieve:
- Page load time under 3 seconds
- Lighthouse performance score above 90
- Zero console errors
- Works on mobile devices"
```

## üìà Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

### Quality Indicators

Track these metrics to improve your prompting:

1. **First Response Quality**: How often do you get usable results immediately?
2. **Iteration Count**: Average number of refinements needed
3. **Implementation Success**: How often does generated code work without modification?
4. **Time to Solution**: Total time from initial prompt to working solution

### Continuous Improvement

#### Keep a Prompt Journal
```
DATE: 2024-01-15
PROMPT: [Your original prompt]
RESULT: [Quality rating 1-10]
ITERATIONS: [Number of refinements needed]
LESSONS: [What worked well, what to improve]
TEMPLATE: [Reusable pattern identified]
```

#### Build a Personal Library

Save effective prompts:
- Successful templates
- Good examples by category
- Common constraint patterns
- Useful context frameworks

## ü§ù Collaborative Prompting

### Team Standards

Establish team prompting guidelines:

```yaml
Code Requests:
  - Always include relevant imports
  - Specify TypeScript when applicable
  - Include basic error handling
  - Add JSDoc comments for functions

Reviews:
  - Focus on security, performance, maintainability
  - Follow team coding standards
  - Include specific improvement suggestions
  - Provide rationale for changes

Architecture:
  - Consider scalability from the start
  - Document trade-offs and decisions
  - Include testing strategies
  - Plan for monitoring and observability
```

### Prompt Sharing

Share effective prompts with the team:
- Create shared prompt templates
- Document successful patterns
- Review and improve team prompts
- Build institutional knowledge

## üéØ Domain-Specific Prompting

### Frontend Development
```
"Create a React component with these specifications:
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Storybook stories for testing
- Unit tests with React Testing Library"
```

### Backend Development
```
"Build an Express.js API endpoint that:
- Handles POST requests to /api/users
- Validates input using Joi schema
- Stores data in PostgreSQL using Prisma
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- Includes error handling and logging
- Has comprehensive API documentation
- Includes integration tests"
```

### DevOps and Infrastructure
```
"Create a Docker setup for this Node.js application:
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- Non-root user for security
- Health check endpoints
- Environment variable configuration
- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Docker Compose for local development
- Production-ready configuration"
```

### Data Science
```
"Build a data analysis pipeline that:
- Loads CSV data using pandas
- Performs exploratory data analysis
- Creates visualizations with matplotlib/seaborn
- Applies statistical tests for significance
- Generates a summary report
- Handles missing data appropriately
- Includes data validation steps"
```

## üìö Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Chaining

Link multiple prompts for complex workflows:

```
Prompt 1: "Analyze this codebase structure and identify architectural issues"
Prompt 2: "Based on the analysis, create a refactoring plan"
Prompt 3: "Implement the first phase of the refactoring plan"
Prompt 4: "Update tests to work with the refactored code"
```

### Conditional Prompting

Use if-then logic in prompts:

```
"Create a user registration form that adapts based on user type:

IF user type is 'business':
  - Include company name field
  - Add tax ID validation
  - Require business email domain

IF user type is 'individual':
  - Include personal name fields
  - Add age verification
  - Optional profile picture upload

COMMON for both types:
  - Email and password validation
  - Terms acceptance
  - Welcome email trigger"
```

### Meta-prompting

Ask Claude to help improve your prompts:

```
"Review this prompt and suggest improvements for clarity and effectiveness:

[Your original prompt]

Focus on:
- Clarity of requirements
- Completeness of context
- Specificity of success criteria
- Structure and organization"
```
