# üìã Plan Mode Guide

> Master Claude Code's planning capabilities for complex multi-step tasks

## üìñ Overview

Plan Mode is Claude Code's most powerful feature for handling complex, multi-step tasks. By pressing `Shift+Tab` before submitting your request, you activate a planning phase where Claude analyzes your request, breaks it down into steps, and presents a comprehensive plan for your approval before execution.

## üéØ What is Plan Mode?

Plan Mode transforms complex requests into structured, reviewable plans:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Claude analyzes your request and identifies all components
2. **Planning Phase**: Creates a detailed, step-by-step execution plan
3. **Review Phase**: You review and approve (or modify) the plan
4. **Execution Phase**: Claude executes the approved plan systematically

## üöÄ How to Activate Plan Mode

### Desktop Application
```
1. Type your complex request
2. Press Shift+Tab (before hitting Enter)
3. Submit your request
4. Review the generated plan
5. Approve or request modifications
```

### Web Interface
```
1. Type your complex request
2. Click the "Plan Mode" button
3. Submit your request
4. Review the generated plan
5. Approve or request modifications
```

### When Plan Mode Activates Automatically
Claude Code automatically suggests Plan Mode for:
- Multi-file operations
- Complex refactoring tasks
- System architecture changes
- Large-scale implementations
- Requests involving multiple tools or steps

## üé™ When to Use Plan Mode

### Perfect Scenarios for Plan Mode

‚ùå "What does this error mean?"
‚ùå "Show me an example of useState"
```

## üìã Plan Mode Workflow

### Phase 1: Request Analysis

Claude analyzes your request and identifies:
- **Scope**: What files, systems, or components are involved
- **Dependencies**: What needs to happen in what order
- **Risks**: Potential issues or complications
- **Requirements**: Missing information or clarifications needed

### Phase 2: Plan Generation

Claude creates a structured plan containing:
- **Overview**: High-level summary of the approach
- **Steps**: Detailed, numbered execution steps
- **File Operations**: Which files will be created, modified, or deleted
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the changes work
- **Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if needed

### Phase 3: Plan Review

You review the plan and can:
- **Approve**: Proceed with execution as planned
- **Modify**: Request changes to specific steps
- **Clarify**: Ask questions about the approach
- **Cancel**: Decide not to proceed

### Phase 4: Execution

Claude executes the approved plan:
- **Step-by-step execution**: Each step is completed before moving to the next
- **Progress updates**: You see what's being done at each step
- **Error handling**: If a step fails, Claude reports the issue and suggests solutions
- **Verification**: Critical steps include verification of success

```

## üîß Plan Optimization Techniques

### 1. **Provide Rich Context**

**Poor Context:**
```
"Update the database"
```

**Rich Context:**
```
"Update the PostgreSQL database schema to support multi-tenant architecture. Current schema has 15 tables with about 100k users. Need to maintain data integrity and zero downtime."
```

### 2. **Specify Constraints**

```
"Implement caching with these constraints:
- Must work with existing Redis setup
- Cannot break current API contracts
- Need to maintain sub-200ms response times
- Must be backward compatible"
```

### 3. **Define Success Criteria**

```
"Optimize the React app with these goals:
- Lighthouse score above 95
- Bundle size under 200KB
- First contentful paint under 1.5s
- Works on IE11+ browsers"
```

### 4. **Include Risk Tolerance**

```
"Migrate to new authentication system:
- Zero tolerance for data loss
- Maximum 2-hour maintenance window
- Must have immediate rollback capability
- Cannot break mobile app integration"
```

## üìä Plan Quality Indicators

### Good Plans Include:

‚úÖ **Clear Steps**: Each step is specific and actionable  
‚úÖ **Logical Order**: Dependencies are properly sequenced  
‚úÖ **Risk Awareness**: Potential issues are identified  
‚úÖ **Testing Strategy**: Verification methods are included  
‚úÖ **Rollback Plan**: Recovery options are provided  
‚úÖ **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of completion  

### Red Flags in Plans:

‚ùå **Vague Steps**: "Update the code" without specifics  
‚ùå **Missing Dependencies**: Steps that can't be completed independently  
‚ùå **No Testing**: No verification of changes  
‚ùå **No Rollback**: No way to undo changes  
‚ùå **Unrealistic Timeline**: Not accounting for complexity  

## üéØ Plan Review Strategies

### Questions to Ask During Review:

1. **Completeness**: Does this plan address all aspects of my request?
2. **Feasibility**: Are all steps technically possible with available resources?
3. **Order**: Is the sequence logical and are dependencies respected?
4. **Risk Management**: Are potential issues identified and addressed?
5. **Testing**: How will we verify each step works correctly?
6. **Rollback**: If something goes wrong, how do we recover?

### Plan Modification Techniques:

#### Adding Steps
```
"Add a step to create database backups before the migration"
```

#### Changing Order
```
"Move the testing step to happen after each service is extracted, not at the end"
```

#### Adding Constraints
```
"Add a constraint that all changes must be backward compatible"
```

#### Risk Mitigation
```
"Add a step to create feature flags for gradual rollout"
```

## üöÄ Advanced Plan Mode Features

### 1. **Conditional Logic in Plans**

Plans can include conditional steps:
```markdown
## Step 5: Database Migration
IF current_version < 2.0:
  - Run migration script v1_to_v2.sql
  - Update version table
ELSE:
  - Skip migration, already at correct version
```

### 2. **Parallel Execution**

Some steps can be done in parallel:
```markdown
## Steps 3-5: Component Development (Parallel)
PARALLEL:
  - Step 3: Create UserProfile component
  - Step 4: Create Settings component  
  - Step 5: Create Dashboard component

THEN:
  - Step 6: Integrate all components
```

### 3. **Checkpoints and Validation**

Plans include verification points:
```markdown
## Step 4: API Integration
- Connect frontend to new API endpoints
- Test all CRUD operations
- Verify error handling

CHECKPOINT: All API calls return expected data
IF checkpoint fails: Review API implementation before proceeding
```

### 4. **Resource Planning**

Plans can include resource estimates:
```markdown
## Resource Requirements
- Estimated time: 2-3 days
- Required tools: Docker, kubectl, migration scripts
- Team members needed: 1 backend dev, 1 DevOps engineer
- External dependencies: DBA approval for schema changes
```

## üé™ Plan Mode Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Clear Intent**

```markdown
Good: "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens, password reset, and role-based access control"

Better: "Implement secure user authentication system with:
- JWT token-based auth with refresh tokens
- Email-based password reset with time limits
- Role-based access control with user/admin roles
- Integration with existing user database
- Mobile app compatibility"
```

### 2. **Specify Non-Functional Requirements**

```markdown
Include requirements like:
- Performance targets
- Security requirements
- Compatibility constraints
- Scalability needs
- Maintenance considerations
```

### 3. **Plan for Different Environments**

```markdown
"Plan should work for:
- Local development environment
- Staging environment with limited data
- Production environment with 1M+ users
- Different database configurations"
```

### 4. **Consider Team Dynamics**

```markdown
"Plan should account for:
- Code review process
- QA testing requirements
- Deployment approvals
- Documentation updates
- Team training needs"
```

## üö® Common Plan Mode Pitfalls

### 1. **Over-Planning Simple Tasks**

‚ùå Don't use Plan Mode for:
```
"Add a CSS class to make text bold"
"Fix a typo in comments"
"Update a configuration value"
```

### 2. **Under-Specifying Complex Tasks**

‚ùå Vague request:
```
"Make the app better"
```

‚úÖ Specific request:
```
"Improve app performance by optimizing database queries, implementing caching, and reducing bundle size to achieve <2s load times"
```

### 3. **Ignoring Plan Reviews**

‚ùå Approving plans without careful review  
‚úÖ Taking time to understand each step  
‚úÖ Asking questions about unclear aspects  
‚úÖ Requesting modifications when needed  

### 4. **Not Providing Enough Context**

‚ùå Missing context:
```
"Refactor the authentication system"
```

‚úÖ Rich context:
```
"Refactor the authentication system in our Node.js/Express app that currently uses sessions. Migrate to JWT tokens while maintaining compatibility with our React frontend and mobile app. Current system handles 10k daily active users."
```

## üìà Plan Mode Success Metrics

### Measure Plan Effectiveness:

1. **Execution Success Rate**: What percentage of approved plans complete successfully?
2. **First-Time Right**: How often does the plan work without modifications?
3. **Time Accuracy**: How close are time estimates to actual execution time?
4. **Risk Prediction**: How well does the plan identify actual issues?
5. **Rollback Usage**: How often do you need to use rollback procedures?

### Continuous Improvement:

- Review completed plans to identify patterns
- Note which types of requests benefit most from Plan Mode
- Refine your request-writing skills based on plan quality
- Build a library of successful plan templates
