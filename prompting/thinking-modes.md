# 🧠 Thinking Modes

> Harness Claude's enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex problem solving

## 📖 Overview

Claude Code offers three distinct thinking modes that engage different levels of cognitive processing. Understanding when and how to use each mode can dramatically improve the quality and depth of responses you receive.

## 🎯 The Three Thinking Modes

### 1. **Default Mode** (Standard Response)
- **When to use**: Simple requests, straightforward tasks, quick questions
- **Processing**: Immediate response based on training
- **Speed**: Fastest
- **Depth**: Surface level

### 2. **think** - Enhanced Reasoning
- **When to use**: Analysis, planning, structured problem-solving
- **Processing**: Step-by-step reasoning with intermediate thoughts
- **Speed**: Moderate
- **Depth**: Thoughtful analysis

### 3. **think hard** - Deep Analysis  
- **When to use**: Complex problems, system design, optimization challenges
- **Processing**: Multi-layered analysis with thorough consideration
- **Speed**: Slower
- **Depth**: Comprehensive examination

### 4. **ultrathink** - Maximum Cognitive Effort
- **When to use**: Extremely complex challenges, novel problems, critical decisions
- **Processing**: Exhaustive analysis from multiple angles
- **Speed**: Slowest
- **Depth**: Maximum reasoning power

## 🚀 Usage Examples

# Complex debugging
ultrathink: "Debug this race condition that only occurs under high load"

# Strategic technical planning
ultrathink: "Plan the technical roadmap for migrating from monolith to microservices"
```

## 🎪 When to Use Each Mode

### Default Mode: Everyday Tasks

**Perfect for:**
- Code snippets and examples

## 📊 Mode Comparison

| Mode | Processing Time | Depth | Use Cases | Example Problems |
|------|----------------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Default** | Instant | Basic | Quick answers | "How to import a module?" |
| **think** | 10-30s | Good | Analysis & planning | "Should I use SQL or NoSQL?" |
| **think hard** | 30-90s | Deep | Complex problems | "Design a microservices architecture" |
| **ultrathink** | 1-3min | Maximum | Critical challenges | "Solve distributed consensus problem" |

## 🔧 Optimization Techniques

### Escalating Complexity

Start simple and escalate when needed:

```bash
# Start with default
"How do I handle form validation in React?"

# If you need more depth
think: "Design a comprehensive form validation system with error handling"

# For complex scenarios
think hard: "Create a flexible validation framework that works across multiple form libraries"

# For critical systems
ultrathink: "Design a validation architecture for financial forms requiring audit trails"
```

### Combining Modes in Conversations

Use different modes for different aspects:

```bash
# Get quick info
"What is GraphQL?"

# Analyze the concept
think: "Compare GraphQL vs REST for my API design"

# Deep implementation planning
think hard: "Design a GraphQL schema for a complex e-commerce system"

# Critical production decision
ultrathink: "Evaluate GraphQL adoption risks for our enterprise system"
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

## 🚨 Mode Selection Guidelines

### Diagnostic Questions

Ask yourself these questions to choose the right mode:

1. **Complexity**: How many interconnected parts does this problem have?
2. **Stakes**: What happens if the solution isn't optimal?
3. **Time**: How much time can I invest in getting the best answer?
4. **Novelty**: How well-understood is this problem domain?
5. **Impact**: How many people/systems will this affect?

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Default | think | think hard | ultrathink |
|----------|---------|--------|------------|------------|
| Problem complexity | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| Implementation stakes | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| Time available | Limited | Some | Moderate | Ample |
| Problem novelty | Known | Somewhat new | Novel | Unprecedented |
| System impact | Minimal | Local | System-wide | Mission-critical |

## 🔄 Iterative Thinking

Sometimes you need to progress through modes:

```bash
# Start with exploration
"What are the options for real-time communication in web apps?"

# Analyze specific approaches
think: "Compare WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events for my use case"

# Deep dive into implementation
think hard: "Design a WebSocket architecture that handles 10k concurrent connections"

# Optimize for production
ultrathink: "Create a fault-tolerant real-time system with global distribution"
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Balancing Speed vs Quality

```
Default Mode: Maximum speed, good enough quality
think Mode: Balanced speed and quality
think hard Mode: Higher quality, acceptable speed
ultrathink Mode: Maximum quality, slower speed
```

### When Time Matters

```bash
# Tight deadline - use default
"Quick implementation of user login"

# Some time available - use think
think: "Plan user authentication with security considerations"

# Adequate time - use think hard
think hard: "Design comprehensive user management system"

# Critical decision - use ultrathink
ultrathink: "Create enterprise-grade identity management architecture"
```

## 🤝 Team Usage Patterns

### Code Reviews
```bash
# Quick review
"Review this function for obvious issues"

# Thorough review
think: "Comprehensive code review with security and performance analysis"

# Critical system review
think hard: "Deep architectural review of this microservice"

# Production system review
ultrathink: "Complete system audit for enterprise deployment"
```

### Architecture Decisions
```bash
# Initial exploration
"What are microservices and when to use them?"

# Planning phase
think: "Evaluate microservices vs monolith for our application"

# Design phase
think hard: "Design microservices architecture with specific service boundaries"

# Implementation phase
ultrathink: "Create production-ready microservices platform with all operational concerns"
```

```

### Contextual Mode Selection
```bash
# Morning exploration (default)
"Show me today's development priorities"

# Midday analysis (think)
think: "Analyze blockers preventing progress on current tasks"

# Afternoon problem-solving (think hard)
think hard: "Solve the complex integration issue discovered this morning"
