## üîß Systematic Debugging Process

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

4. **Check recent changes** - Code, config, infrastructure
5. **Document environment** - Version, platform, dependencies

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation
1. **Brainstorm potential causes** based on symptoms
2. **Rank hypotheses** by likelihood and impact
3. **Create testable predictions** for each hypothesis
4. **Design minimal test cases** to verify/falsify
5. **Plan investigation order** from most to least likely

### Phase 3: Systematic Investigation
1. **Binary search** through code/time/conditions
2. **Controlled experiments** with isolated variables
3. **Instrumentation** with targeted logging/metrics
4. **Reproduction attempts** with varied conditions
5. **Data collection** from multiple sources

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis
1. **Trace the causal chain** from symptom to source
2. **Identify contributing factors** beyond immediate cause
3. **Assess impact scope** of the underlying issue
4. **Document findings** with evidence and reasoning
5. **Plan comprehensive fix** addressing root cause

### Phase 5: Verification & Prevention
1. **Implement fix** with comprehensive testing
2. **Verify resolution** in all affected scenarios
3. **Add regression tests** to prevent recurrence
4. **Update monitoring** to catch similar issues early
5. **Document lessons learned** for team knowledge

## üéØ Specialized Hunting Strategies

### The Narrowing Net
1. Start with broad system monitoring
2. Gradually narrow focus to suspicious components
3. Isolate variables one by one
4. Create minimal reproduction cases
5. Pinpoint exact failure conditions

### The Time Machine
1. Identify when the bug first appeared
2. Binary search through commits/deployments
3. Compare before/after states
4. Trace evolution of the problematic code
5. Understand the change that introduced the bug

### The Stress Test
1. Create automated stress testing scenarios
2. Vary load patterns and timing
3. Monitor system behavior under stress
4. Identify breaking points and thresholds
5. Correlate failures with resource usage

### The Canary Trap

2. Deploy monitoring in production
3. Wait for the bug to trigger monitoring
4. Capture detailed state when bug occurs

```

### Performance Degradation
```bash
"Our API response times have been gradually increasing over the past month. Use bug-hunter to identify the root cause of this performance degradation."
```

### Memory Leak Investigation
```bash
"Our Node.js application's memory usage keeps growing and eventually crashes. Use bug-hunter to find and fix this memory leak."
```

Remember: Great debugging is part art, part science. Be methodical, stay curious, and never give up on finding the truth behind the symptoms.
