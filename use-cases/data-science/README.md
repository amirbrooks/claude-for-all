- Documentation and reporting
- Code optimization and debugging

## 🚀 Quick Examples

### Data Analysis
```python
# Ask Claude to analyze your dataset
claude "Analyze this CSV file and create visualizations"
# Claude will read the file, understand the data, and generate insights
```

### ML Model Development
```python
# Get help with model selection and implementation
claude "Build a classification model for this dataset with feature engineering"
# Claude provides complete implementation with explanations
```
