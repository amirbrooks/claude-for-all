## 🎯 Overview

Claude Code revolutionizes DevOps practices by providing intelligent assistance for:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) development
- CI/CD pipeline creation and optimization
- Container orchestration and management
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Security and compliance automation

## 🚀 Quick Examples

### Infrastructure Automation
```bash
# Generate Terraform configurations
claude "Create AWS infrastructure for a Node.js app with RDS and load balancer"
# Get complete IaC with best practices
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow generation
claude "Create a CI/CD pipeline for React app with testing and deployment"
# Receive complete workflow with all stages
```

## 📋 Common Use Cases
